<Aside type="caution" title="Experimental Feature">
Hybrid deployment is a cutting-edge feature currently in **active development and testing**. The CLI workflows and APIs described here are highly experimental and subject to significant change without notice. **This feature is not yet ready for production use.**
</Aside>

<Aside type="note" title="Edge Node Connectivity">
Hybrid edge nodes communicate with the FrameWorks network via public APIs (HTTP/gRPC). They do **not** participate in the internal WireGuard mesh (Privateer), which is reserved for backend infrastructure nodes.
</Aside>

The vision for FrameWorks' hybrid deployment is to offer the best of both worlds: the control of self-hosted infrastructure with the convenience of a managed services. This will enable you to do the heavy lifting on your own hardware, while the FrameWorks network handles crucial services like load balancing, analytics, and orchestration.

## The Hybrid Vision

Our goal for hybrid deployment is to empower you with:

**Leveraging your own hardware:**
- The ability to run edge nodes anywhere you have servers.
- Flexibility to ingest streams locally or route them through the network.
- Optimized delivery by serving viewers from your nodes when they are geographically closest.
- Integrated analytics and monitoring without the need for you to build it yourself.

**Seamless integration with the FrameWorks network:**
- The core Control Plane services (Commodore, Quartermaster) remain centrally managed.
- Analytics ingestion and storage are handled by the FrameWorks platform.
- Load balancer decisions (Foghorn) are orchestrated by the network.
- Full access to the dashboard and API is maintained.

## How It Works

    subgraph YN[Your Edge Node]
        MS[MistServer<br/>+ Helmsman]
    end

    subgraph FN[FrameWorks Network]
        COM[Commodore<br/>stream auth]
        FOG[Foghorn<br/>load balancer]
        DL[Decklog<br/>event ingress]
    end

    MS -->|gRPC| FOG
    FOG -->|HTTP| COM
    FOG -->|gRPC| DL
```

1. **MistServer** handles the actual streaming: RTMP ingest, transcoding, HLS/DASH/WebRTC delivery
2. **Helmsman** (our sidecar) forwards all triggers and metrics to Foghorn via gRPC
3. **Foghorn** enriches events (GeoIP, tenant context), validates stream keys via Commodore (HTTP), and forwards to Decklog
4. **Decklog** receives enriched events from Foghorn and produces them to Kafka for analytics

## Prerequisites

Before you start:
- A server with Docker and Docker Compose
- Public IP (for viewers to reach you)
- DNS record pointing to your server
- Ports 80, 443, 1935, and 8080 available
- FrameWorks account with node enrollment permissions

Hardware minimums:
- 4 CPU cores
- 8 GB RAM
- 100 GB storage (more if you're doing recordings)
- 1 Gbps network

## Future Implementation Steps

Once hybrid deployment is stable, these guides will help you:

1.  Set up your edge node (install Docker, run preflight checks).
2.  Connect to the network (enroll your node with Quartermaster).
3.  Manage your node (update, monitor, troubleshoot).

## Envisioned Use Cases

**Hybrid deployment will be a strong consideration if:**
- You possess existing, underutilized server capacity.
- Your primary viewer base is concentrated in a geographic region not optimally served by our existing edge network.
- Compliance regulations necessitate keeping stream data on-premise.
- You require ultra-low latency streaming, surpassing what our nearest edge nodes can provide.

**Conversely, hybrid deployment might not be the most suitable option if:**
- You lack the operational capacity or expertise to maintain server infrastructure.
- Your viewer base is broadly distributed globally, where our comprehensive network coverage is already optimized.
- Your primary goal is to stream with minimal infrastructure management overhead.

## What's Different from Full Self-Hosting

Hybrid gives you edge nodes. Full self-hosting gives you everything: the control plane, databases, Kafka, the dashboard, etc.

| Aspect | Hybrid | Full Self-Host |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| You manage | Edge nodes only | Everything |
| Analytics | FrameWorks-hosted | Your ClickHouse |
| Dashboard | Hosted dashboard | Your deployment |
| Complexity | Low-medium | High |

If you want total independence, see the [Infrastructure Operators](/operators/deployment) guide.
