## 1. Create an Account

Head to [%APP_URL%](%APP_URL%) and sign up with your email.

## 2. Create a Stream

In the dashboard:
1. Click **Streams** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Stream**
3. Give it a name (this is just for you to identify it)
4. Click **Create**

You'll land on your stream's detail page.

## 3. Copy Your Stream Key

Click the **Keys** tab, then click the copy button next to your stream key.

Keep this secret—anyone with your stream key can broadcast to your channel. Stream keys are tied to your account and the specific stream you created.

## 4. Configure Your Encoder

Open OBS Studio (or your preferred streaming software). For the quickest setup, we'll use RTMP. For advanced configurations like WHIP or specific optimizations (e.g., keyframe intervals, OBS profiles), refer to our [Encoder Setup Guide](/streamers/encoder-setup).

**In OBS Studio:**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Stream**.
2. Set **Service:** `Custom`.
3. For **Server:** Enter `%RTMP_URL%`.
4. For **Stream Key:** Paste the stream key you copied from your FrameWorks dashboard.

Once configured, hit **Start Streaming** in OBS.

## 5. Watch Your Stream

Back in the dashboard, your stream status should flip to **Live** within a few seconds.

The **Playback Info** card shows your Playback ID. You should also be able to find direct links for various protocols & containers, ready to plug into your player of choice.
