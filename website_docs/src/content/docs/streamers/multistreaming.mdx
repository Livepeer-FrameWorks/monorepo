Multistreaming lets you push a single live broadcast to multiple external platforms at once. When your stream goes live, FrameWorks automatically pushes to every enabled target — no third-party restreaming service required.

<Aside type="tip">
  Multistreaming uses native MistServer push, so there's no re-encoding or added latency. Each
  target receives the same bitstream directly from the origin node.
</Aside>

## How It Works

1. **Configure targets** — Add push targets to your stream via the dashboard or API
2. **Go live** — Start broadcasting as usual (OBS, StreamCrafter, SRT, etc.)
3. **Automatic push** — FrameWorks detects the stream going live and pushes to all enabled targets
4. **Automatic stop** — When your stream ends, all pushes stop automatically

Each push target has a live status indicator: **idle**, **pushing**, or **failed**.

## Supported Platforms

| Platform    | Protocol       | Ingest URL                                                                         |
| ----------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Twitch      | RTMP           | `rtmp://live.twitch.tv/app/{stream_key}`                                           |
| YouTube     | RTMP           | `rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2/{stream_key}`                                     |
| Facebook    | RTMPS          | `rtmps://live-api-s.facebook.com:443/rtmp/{stream_key}`                            |
| Kick        | RTMPS          | `rtmps://fa723fc1b171.global-contribute.live-video.net/app/{stream_key}`           |
| X (Twitter) | RTMPS          | `rtmps://prod-ec-us-west-2.compose.broadcast.live-video.net:443/rtmp/{stream_key}` |
| Custom      | RTMP/RTMPS/SRT | Any valid `rtmp://`, `rtmps://`, or `srt://` URI                                   |

<Aside type="caution">
  Your stream key for each platform is stored securely and masked in API responses. Never share your
  stream keys publicly.

## Dashboard

In the stream detail page, open the **Multistream** tab to manage push targets.

- **Add Target** — Select a platform, enter your stream key, and give it a name
- **Enable/Disable** — Toggle targets on or off without deleting them
- **Status** — See real-time push status for each target
- **Edit** — Update the name, stream key, or target URI at any time
- **Delete** — Remove targets you no longer need

## GraphQL API

### Add a Push Target

```graphql
mutation {
  createPushTarget(
    streamId: "stream-global-id"
    input: {
      platform: "twitch"
      name: "My Twitch Channel"
      targetUri: "rtmp://live.twitch.tv/app/live_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
    }
  ) {
    id
    name
    platform
    targetUri
    isEnabled
    status
  }
}
```

### List Push Targets

Push targets are available as a field on the `Stream` type:

```graphql
query {
  stream(id: "stream-global-id") {
    id
    name
    pushTargets {
      id
      name
      platform
      targetUri
      isEnabled
      status
      lastError
      lastPushedAt
    }
  }
}
```

<Aside type="note">
  The `targetUri` field is masked in API responses — the stream key portion is redacted (e.g.,
  `rtmp://live.twitch.tv/app/live_****xxxx`). Full URIs are only used internally when pushing.
</Aside>

### Update a Push Target

```graphql
mutation {
  updatePushTarget(id: "push-target-global-id", input: { isEnabled: false }) {
    id
    isEnabled
    status
  }
}
```

### Delete a Push Target

```graphql
mutation {
  deletePushTarget(id: "push-target-global-id") {
    success
    deletedId
  }
}
```

## Bandwidth Considerations

Each push target consumes upstream bandwidth on the origin node proportional to your stream's bitrate. For a 6 Mbps stream with 3 push targets, the origin node uses ~18 Mbps of upload bandwidth for multistreaming alone.

Keep this in mind when:

- Streaming at high bitrates (4K, high-FPS)
- Adding many simultaneous targets
- Using nodes with limited upload capacity

## Troubleshooting

**Target shows "failed" status**

- Verify your stream key is correct and hasn't expired
- Check that the platform isn't blocking your IP or account
- Some platforms require additional setup (e.g., Facebook requires creating a live broadcast first)

**Push doesn't start when stream goes live**

- Ensure the target is **enabled** (not just created)
- Check that your stream is actually live on the origin node
- Review the event log on the stream detail page for errors

**High latency to external platforms**

- This is normal — external platforms add their own buffering (typically 5-15 seconds)
- The push from FrameWorks is real-time; additional delay is on the destination platform's side
