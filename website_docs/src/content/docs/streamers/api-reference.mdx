import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

FrameWorks offers a powerful GraphQL API that puts you in full control. Whether you need to programmatically create streams, manage keys, or pull detailed analytics, our API provides a unified interface for all platform operations.

<Aside type="note" title="Same schema everywhere">
Managed and self-hosted deployments run the same Bridge (API Gateway) and GraphQL schema. Some fields may return null or errors if the backing service isn’t deployed.
</Aside>

## GraphQL Endpoint

All API interactions are performed through a single GraphQL endpoint. This allows you to fetch exactly the data you need in a single request.

```
%GATEWAY_URL%/graphql
```

Subscriptions use WebSocket:

```
%GATEWAY_URL%/graphql/ws
```

All operations go through this single endpoint. Queries read data, mutations change it.

## Authentication

Most requests need a token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_OR_API_TOKEN
```

Get your API token from **Developer → API** in the dashboard.

The dashboard may authenticate via httpOnly cookies.  
Public allowlist (no auth required): `resolveViewerEndpoint`, `resolveIngestEndpoint`, `serviceInstancesHealth` (queries only).

## Try It Out

The dashboard has a built-in GraphQL explorer. Go to **Developer → API** to run queries against your account.

Or use any GraphQL client:
- [Altair](https://altairgraphql.dev/)
- [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground)
- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)

## Common Usage Patterns

Here are the most frequent operations you'll likely need when building your integration.

### List Your Streams

```graphql
query {
  streamsConnection(page: { first: 20 }) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        playbackId
        createdAt
        metrics {
          status
          currentViewers
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Create a Stream

Most mutations return a **union** result. Always check `__typename`.

```graphql
mutation {
  createStream(input: { name: "My New Stream" }) {
    __typename
    ... on Stream {
      id
      name
      streamKey
      playbackId
    }
    ... on ValidationError {
      message
      field
    }
    ... on AuthError {
      message
    }
  }
}
```

### Get Stream Details

```graphql
query {
  stream(id: "stream-global-id") {
    id
    name
    streamKey
    playbackId
    record
    metrics {
      status
      currentViewers
      isLive
      updatedAt
    }
  }
}
```

### Create a Stream Key

```graphql
mutation {
  createStreamKey(streamId: "stream-global-id", input: { name: "OBS Key" }) {
    __typename
    ... on StreamKey {
      id
      keyValue
      keyName
      createdAt
    }
    ... on ValidationError {
      message
      field
    }
    ... on AuthError {
      message
    }
  }
}
```

### Get Stream Analytics

Analytics queries require you to specify a time range. Data is returned in aggregated form to help you visualize viewer engagement and usage.

```graphql
query {
  analytics {
    usage {
      streaming {
        streamAnalyticsDailyConnection(
          streamId: "stream-global-id"
          timeRange: { start: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z", end: "2024-01-07T00:00:00Z" }
          page: { first: 30 }
        ) {
          edges {
            node {
              day
              totalViews
              uniqueViewers
              egressBytes
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note: analytics `streamId` filters use the Stream global ID (`Stream.id`). Responses return Relay IDs; use `Stream.streamId` for the public UUID used outside GraphQL.

## Playback Resolution

When building a custom player, use the `resolveViewerEndpoint` query. This ensures your viewers are routed to the geographically closest and healthiest edge node for the best possible experience.

```graphql
query {
  resolveViewerEndpoint(contentId: "pk_your_playback_id") {
    primary {
      nodeId
      baseUrl
      protocol
      url
      geoDistance
      loadScore
      outputs
    }
    fallbacks {
      nodeId
      baseUrl
      protocol
      url
    }
    metadata {
      status
      isLive
      viewers
      title
      description
      contentId
      contentType
    }
  }
}
```

Returns a primary endpoint (optimal for the viewer's location) plus fallbacks. Use the primary endpoint first, fall back to others if it fails.

`contentId` is a **playbackId** for live streams, VOD uploads, clips, and DVR recordings (not the raw hash).

If the gateway can’t determine a viewer IP (for GeoIP routing), this query will error.

## Error Handling

GraphQL errors come in the `errors` array. Mutation errors for unions are returned as typed objects (check `__typename`).

```json
{
  "data": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Stream not found",
      "path": ["stream"],
      "extensions": {
        "code": "NOT_FOUND"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Common codes:
- `UNAUTHORIZED` - Missing or invalid token
- `FORBIDDEN` - Token lacks required permissions
- `NOT_FOUND` - Resource doesn't exist
- `VALIDATION_ERROR` - Invalid input


## SDKs

No official GraphQL SDK yet. Use any GraphQL client in your language of choice. An API Client SDK is planned (see **Developer → SDKs**).

JavaScript example with `graphql-request`:

```javascript
import { GraphQLClient, gql } from 'graphql-request';

const client = new GraphQLClient('%GATEWAY_URL%/graphql', {
  headers: {
    Authorization: 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN',
  },
});

const query = gql`
  query {
    streamsConnection(first: 5) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          name
          playbackId
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;

const data = await client.request(query);
console.log(data.streamsConnection.edges.map((e) => e.node));
```

## Schema Reference

The full schema is available via introspection. In any GraphQL client, run:

```graphql
{
  __schema {
    types {
      name
      description
    }
  }
}
```

Or use the dashboard's API Explorer which shows docs inline.
