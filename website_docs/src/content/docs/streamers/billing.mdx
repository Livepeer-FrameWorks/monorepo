FrameWorks billing is in beta. Today we offer a **Free shared cluster** and a **prepaid balance** model. Paid tiers below are planned as we roll out paid clusters.

<Aside type="note">
  **Beta Pricing:** Current rates are beta pricing. As we scale, pricing may adjust—but you keep the
  allowances you signed up for throughout beta.
</Aside>

## What You Pay For

Paid tiers use **resource-based billing**:

| Resource              | What It Measures                          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Delivered Minutes** | Total viewer playback time                |
| **Storage**           | Average GB stored over the billing period |

The delivered minutes price is **all-inclusive**: bandwidth, transcoding, and ABR ladder generation. No separate encoding fees.

<Aside type="tip">
  **API requests are free.** Stream creation, analytics queries, configuration changes—all API
  operations cost nothing. You only pay when viewers watch or you store recordings.
</Aside>

## Free Tier

Access to a shared cluster on a fair-use basis. No metering, no billing.

**Included:**

- Shared cluster access
- Livepeer-backed transcoding
- Analytics dashboard
- API access
- Recording (beta)

**Limitations:**

- 30-day recording retention (beta; plan-based in the future)
- No GPU hours
- Watermarked player
- Community support only
- No SLA

## Pay-As-You-Go (Current)

Add funds to a prepaid balance and pay as usage accrues. Usage is deducted at the rates below.

| Resource          | Rate         |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| Delivered Minutes | €0.00049/min |
| Storage (avg GB)  | €0.01/GB     |
| GPU Hours         | €0.50/hr     |

## Metered Tiers (Planned)

Paid tiers include monthly allocations with overage billing:

| Tier       | Base   | Delivered Minutes | GPU Hours | Retention |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Supporter  | €79    | 150K              | 10        | 90 days   |
| Developer  | €249   | 500K              | 50        | 180 days  |
| Production | €999   | 2M                | 250       | 365 days  |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom            | Custom    | Custom    |

**Overages (metered tiers):**

| Tier       | Delivered Minutes | Storage (avg GB) | GPU Hours |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| Supporter  | €0.00049/min      | €0.01/GB         | €0.50/hr  |
| Developer  | €0.00047/min      | €0.008/GB        | €0.50/hr  |
| Production | €0.00045/min      | €0.005/GB        | €0.50/hr  |
| Enterprise | Custom            | Custom           | Custom    |

## Billing Models

### Prepaid

Load credits first, use resources as you go. Balance decreases as usage accrues.

**Thresholds:**

| Balance     | Effect                                       |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Below €5    | Low balance warning                          |
| €0 or below | New ingests blocked; playback may return 402 |
| Below -€10  | Account suspended; streams terminated        |

### Postpaid (Planned)

Monthly subscription with included allocations. Overages invoiced at period end. Requires verified billing details. Planned for paid tiers; not active yet.

## Topping Up

### Card

Pay via Stripe or Mollie. Funds credit immediately after checkout.

### Crypto

Send ETH or USDC on Ethereum, Base, or Arbitrum. LPT is supported on Ethereum and Arbitrum.

**Confirmations:**

- Ethereum: 12 confirmations
- Base: 10 confirmations
- Arbitrum: 10 confirmations

### x402 Protocol

For programmatic clients, FrameWorks supports the [x402 protocol](https://www.x402.org/).

When balance is insufficient, the API returns HTTP 402 with payment requirements. Clients sign an EIP-3009 authorization and retry with the `X-PAYMENT` (or `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`) header to top up automatically.

x402 supports USDC on Base and Arbitrum. For ETH/LPT, use the standard deposit flow.

## Invoicing

FrameWorks is registered in the EU and follows EU VAT invoicing rules.

### Why the €100 Threshold

EU VAT law allows **simplified invoices** for transactions under €100. These invoices don't require customer details—just the supplier info, amount, and VAT breakdown.

For payments **under €100**, we issue simplified invoices automatically. No billing details needed from you.

For payments **€100 or above**, EU law requires a full VAT invoice with your details (name, address, and VAT number if applicable). You must add billing details in your account settings before making large payments.

### B2B in the EU

If you're a business in the EU, add your VAT number in account settings. We validate the format and apply reverse charge (0% VAT) automatically.

### Record Keeping

All invoices are available in your account. We retain transaction records for 10 years per EU requirements.

## Cluster Tiers

FrameWorks supports multiple deployment models with different billing characteristics:

| Tier                   | Description                                                                                                                    | Billing                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shared (Community)** | Free rate-limited access to a shared cluster.                                                                                  | No metering, fair-use.                               |
| **Shared (Premium)**   | Paid tiers on shared infrastructure with higher limits.                                                                        | Per-resource metering (delivered minutes + storage). |
| **Dedicated**          | Isolated cluster with dedicated Foghorn and edges — operated by FrameWorks or self-hosted on-premise.                          | Custom pricing via `cluster_pricing`.                |
| **Hybrid**             | Self-hosted edges that fall back to the primary shared cluster. Edges federate via Foghorn; control/data plane remains shared. | Per-cluster usage attribution.                       |
| **Marketplace**        | Third-party operators publish clusters with custom pricing. Tenants subscribe via the marketplace.                             | Operator-set pricing via `cluster_subscriptions`.    |

Usage is attributed per cluster: the analytics pipeline tags every event with `cluster_id` (serving cluster) and `origin_cluster_id` (where the stream was ingested). Billing summaries are generated per cluster for settlement.
