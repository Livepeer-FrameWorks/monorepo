Encountering issues with your stream? We're here to help. This guide covers common problems related to connection, playback, encoding, and API usage.

## Can't Connect to Ingest

If your encoder fails to connect, the issue is usually a mismatch in configuration or a network block.

### "Connection refused" in OBS

The encoder can't reach our servers.

**Check these first:**
1. **RTMP URL:** Verify it is exactly `%RTMP_URL%`.
2. **Stream Key:** Ensure you've copied the active key from the **Stream Key** card on your dashboard.
3. **Port 1935:** Some corporate or school networks block RTMP. Try a different network (like a mobile hotspot) or use SRT.
4. **Service Status:** Check our Discord community for any ongoing maintenance or outages.

### "Authentication failed"

Your stream key is wrong or revoked.

1. Go to your stream in the dashboard
2. Click **Stream Keys** tab
3. Create a new key or copy an existing active one
4. Paste into OBS (Settings → Stream → Stream Key)

### Stream Connects but Drops Immediately

This typically indicates network instability or packet loss between your location and our ingest server.

**Troubleshooting steps:**
- **Check Ping:** Run `ping` against your ingest hostname. Consistent times under 100ms are ideal.
- **Check for Packet Loss:** Run `ping -c 100 <ingest-hostname>` and look for any percentage of loss. Even 1% loss can disrupt a stream.
- **Try Alternative Protocols:** If your ISP throttles RTMP (port 1935), try switching to SRT or WHIP, which handle unstable networks better.

## Playback Problems

### Viewers see "Stream not found"

The playback ID doesn't match an active stream.

1. Is the stream actually live? The dashboard shows status
2. Is the URL exactly right? Playback IDs are case-sensitive
3. Did you accidentally use the stream key instead of the playback ID?

### Video plays but no audio

**For viewers:**
- Browser muted the tab. Check the tab icon and unmute
- The video is muted by default. Click the volume icon in the player

**For streamers:**
- Check OBS audio mixer: is the bar moving when you speak?
- Verify audio codec is AAC (not MP3 or raw PCM)
- Make sure the correct audio source is selected in OBS

### Constant buffering

**On the viewer's end:**
- Slow connection. The player will drop to a lower quality, but there's a limit
- Too far from the nearest edge node (we're expanding coverage)

**On your end:**
- Your upload can't keep up with your bitrate
- Rule of thumb: `upload speed > 2× stream bitrate`
- If you have 10 Mbps upload, don't stream above 5 Mbps

### Video freezes but audio continues

Classic encoder overload.

**Quick fixes in OBS:**
1. Switch to hardware encoding (NVENC for Nvidia, AMF for AMD, QSV for Intel)
2. Lower output resolution: 1080p → 720p
3. Use a faster encoder preset
4. Close Chrome (seriously, it's always Chrome)

### 10-30 second delay

That's normal for HLS. It's not a bug, just how the protocol works.

For lower latency:
- Use WebRTC/WHEP playback URLs for sub-second latency (the player auto-selects optimal protocol)
- Or enable Low Latency HLS in your encoder if you need broader compatibility

## Encoding Performance & Quality

### "Encoding overloaded" in OBS

Your CPU can't keep up.

**Solutions:**
1. **Use GPU encoding** - Settings → Output → Encoder → select NVENC/AMD/QSV
2. **Lower resolution** - 1080p60 is demanding; try 720p30
3. **Faster preset** - "veryfast" instead of "slow"
4. **Close background apps** - especially browsers and video editors

### Choppy/stuttery output

**If the OBS preview is smooth but the stream is choppy:**
- Network issue. Check for packet loss
- Bitrate too high for your connection

**If the preview is also choppy:**
- CPU/GPU overloaded
- Check if OBS shows a red "Encoding overloaded" warning

### Green or Purple Artifacts

These visual glitches are typically caused by outdated GPU drivers or a corrupted encoder state.

1. **Update Drivers:** Install the latest drivers for your GPU.
2. **Test Software Encoding:** Switch to x264 temporarily to rule out hardware issues.
3. **Restart:** Completely restart OBS (and potentially your PC).
4. **Check Temperatures:** Ensure your GPU isn't thermal throttling.

## Dashboard Issues

### Can't log in

1. Clear cookies for the app domain
2. Try incognito mode
3. Check if your email is verified

### Stream shows "offline" but I'm streaming

The dashboard polls every few seconds. Give it 10 seconds and refresh.

If still offline:
- Verify your encoder says "Connected" or "Live"
- Check the stream key matches
- Look at the OBS stats panel for errors

### Analytics missing or delayed

Analytics have a 2-3 minute delay. If you just started streaming, give it time.

For older streams:
- Make sure the stream was actually live (not just connected)
- You need at least one viewer (your own browser counts)

## API Errors

### 401 Unauthorized

Token missing, invalid, or revoked.

**For API tokens (programmatic access):**
1. Create a new token from **Developer → API** in the dashboard
2. Token values are shown only once. If you lost your key, you can revoke it and create a new one in the webapp
3. Check if the token was revoked (it won't be in your active tokens list)
4. By default, API tokens never expire unless you set an expiration when creating

**For session tokens (dashboard access):**
1. Your browser session may have expired. The webapp should catch this on a page refresh.
2. Clear cookies for the app domain and re-authenticate

Make sure the header is `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN` (not just the token).

### 403 Forbidden

You don't have access to this resource.

- Are you accessing another tenant's data by mistake?
- Does your API key have the required scopes?
- Is this feature available on your plan?

### 429 Too Many Requests

You're hitting rate limits.

- Add exponential backoff to retries
- Cache responses when possible
- Batch operations instead of many small requests

### 500 Internal Server Error

Something broke on our end.

1. Wait a minute and retry
2. Check [status.frameworks.network](https://status.frameworks.network)
3. If it keeps happening, file a support ticket with:
   - The request you made
   - The timestamp
   - The `x-request-id` header from the response

## Still Stuck?

1. **Search these docs** - Cmd/Ctrl+K opens search
2. **Discord** - Other streamers might have hit the same issue: [%DISCORD_URL%](%DISCORD_URL%)
3. **GitHub** - [Open an issue](%GITHUB_URL%/issues) with your stream ID and timestamps
