## Done

_Rotating highlight of recently shipped, production‑ready capabilities. For full history, use GitHub Projects._

### Video Engine

- **Ingest**: RTMP, SRT, and WHIP support.
- **Delivery**: Low-latency HLS, WebRTC, and DASH.
- **Stream Control**: Stream CRUD, multiple keys per stream, and playback IDs.
- **Media**: DVR recording (with retention policies), server-side clipping, and VOD uploads.

### Core Platform

- **Tenancy**: Native multi-tenant isolation.
- **Auth**: JWT and API Token management.
- **Billing**: Usage tracking, cost breakdowns, and invoice generation.
- **Infrastructure**: Geo-aware load balancing, Cloudflare DNS automation, and ACME certificates.
- **Reliability**: Service health endpoints are internal only; a public status page is not yet implemented (tracked in GitHub Projects).

### Data & Analytics

- **Real-time**: Viewer counts and stream health metrics (buffer, packet loss).
- **Insights**: Geographic breakdowns (Country/City).
- **Pipeline**: Kafka → ClickHouse analytics pipeline.
- **System**: Node performance metrics.

### Developer Experience

- **API**: GraphQL API with subscriptions and dashboard Explorer.
- **Components**: Web Player (NPM) and StreamCrafter (Broadcasting) SDKs.
- **MCP Server**: AI agent integration via Model Context Protocol.
  - Account, billing, stream, and analytics resources
  - Stream management tools (create, configure, playback)
  - Onboarding and troubleshooting prompts
- **Skipper AI Video Consultant**: RAG-grounded streaming expert with full tool orchestration. [User Guide](/agents/skipper), [Operator Guide](/operators/skipper)
  - Knowledge base: 10+ curated documentation domains (FrameWorks, MistServer, FFmpeg, OBS, SRT, HLS, nginx-rtmp, Livepeer, WebRTC, DASH) with pgvector semantic search
  - QoE diagnostic tools (rebuffering, buffer health, packet loss, routing, anomaly detection)
  - Stream management, billing, and GraphQL introspection via tool orchestration
  - Confidence tagging (verified / sourced / best_guess / unknown) with source citations
  - Web search fallback (Tavily, Brave, SearXNG)
  - Background heartbeat monitoring with proactive alerts and notifications
  - Billing and metering integration
  - Available in dashboard, docs site widget, and via MCP for external agents
- **Support Messaging**: Deckhand integration with Chatwoot for in-app support.
- **Protocols**: x402 for machine-to-machine payments.

## In Progress

_Active development. Core functionality is established; work is focused on full integration, UI exposure, and production hardening._

### Platform & Infrastructure

- **Cloud Federation**: Hardening edge node connectivity and production-grade subdomain routing.
- **Cluster Provisioning**: Finalizing end-to-end validation for CLI-based deployment workflows, including on-demand control-plane services (Foghorn).

### Product & Services

- **Livepeer Gateway**: Transcoding is active. Work is focused on native integration and exposed controls.
