## In Progress

These features are currently being actively developed. Core functionality may be present but is not yet fully integrated into the user interface or public API.

### Custom Domains
DNS and SSL work. Missing: tenant UI and automatic triggers.

### Payment Processing
Stripe and Mollie webhook endpoints exist. Missing: wiring to actually process payments.

### Livepeer Gateway Integration
Transcoding works via Livepeer network works, but we want a more native integration. Also need to add tracking for transcoded minutes...

## In the Pipeline

These items are in the design or early prototype phase. Some features may be available for early access testing.

### AV Device Discovery
Auto-detect IP cameras, webcams, HDMI inputs. Code lives in MistServer fork, needs merge and standalone binary packaging.

### Multi-stream Compositing
PiP, overlays, mixing. Media server supports it, needs processing node orchestration and UI.

### Hybrid Cloud
Connect your own edge nodes. Software ready, needs customer subdomain routing.

### AI Processing
Video analysis and inference. Early experiments, needs orchestration layer.
