This document outlines the development trajectory for Frameworks. We believe in building in the open, giving you full visibility into what is live, what is currently being built, and what we plan to tackle next.

Please note that while we strive for accuracy, priorities can evolve based on user feedback and technical discovery. If a specific feature is critical to your deployment, please reach out to the team.

For full context, history, and status updates, see GitHub Projects (public): https://github.com/orgs/Livepeer-FrameWorks/projects

## Done

_Rotating highlight of recently shipped, production‑ready capabilities. For full history, use GitHub Projects._

### Video Engine

- **Ingest**: RTMP, SRT, and WHIP support.
- **Delivery**: Low-latency HLS, WebRTC, and DASH.
- **Stream Control**: Stream CRUD, multiple keys per stream, and playback IDs.
- **Media**: DVR recording (with retention policies), server-side clipping, and VOD uploads.

### Core Platform

- **Tenancy**: Native multi-tenant isolation.
- **Auth**: JWT and API Token management.
- **Billing**: Usage tracking, cost breakdowns, and invoice generation.
- **Infrastructure**: Geo-aware load balancing, Cloudflare DNS automation, and ACME certificates.
- **Reliability**: Service health endpoints are internal only; a public status page is not yet implemented (tracked in GitHub Projects).

### Data & Analytics

- **Real-time**: Viewer counts and stream health metrics (buffer, packet loss).
