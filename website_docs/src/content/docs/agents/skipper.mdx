Skipper is the platform's AI video streaming consultant. Ask it about live streaming architecture, codecs, encoding, CDN behavior, protocols, deploying your own media servers, or troubleshoot a specific stream — and get answers grounded in curated documentation with source citations.

## Where to Find It

**In the dashboard** — full-page chat at `/skipper` with conversation history, stream diagnostics, and management actions.

**On the docs site** — floating chat panel (toggle with <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl+J</kbd>). Read-only mode: Skipper can search and explain, but won't modify anything.

**Via MCP** — your AI agent can use `ask_consultant` for full-pipeline answers, or the `video_consultant` prompt for a guided persona, through the [MCP server](/agents/mcp).

## What It Can Help With

**Documentation questions** — "How do I configure SRT encryption in MistServer?", "What codec settings does OBS recommend for 1080p streaming?"

**Troubleshooting** — "My viewers are buffering on the European edge" triggers diagnostic tools that analyze rebuffering patterns, packet loss, buffer health, and CDN routing for your stream.

**Platform operations** — "Create a stream called Weekly Standup with DVR enabled" or "Show me my current billing usage" — Skipper has full access to the platform API through the Gateway.

**General streaming knowledge** — codecs, protocols, bitrate planning, latency tradeoffs. Answers from general knowledge are tagged as `best_guess` so you know when to verify.

## Knowledge Base

Skipper's answers are grounded in curated documentation:

| Domain     | Sources                                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FrameWorks | Platform docs, marketing site                                 |
| MistServer | Full documentation sitemap                                    |
| FFmpeg     | Core tools, codecs, formats, protocols, filters               |
| OBS Studio | Knowledge base articles — encoding, capture, streaming        |
| SRT        | Haivision protocol docs — encryption, handshake, bonding, API |
| HLS        | RFC 8216 and draft RFC 8216bis                                |
| nginx-rtmp | Wiki — directives, control module, examples                   |
| Ecosystem  | Livepeer, Daydream, WebRTC, DASH references                   |

Operators can extend the knowledge base with custom sources. See the [operator guide](/operators/skipper).

## Confidence Tagging

Every answer is tagged so you know how much to trust it:

- **verified** — grounded in knowledge base documentation, with source URLs
- **sourced** — backed by live web search results
- **best_guess** — from the model's general knowledge, not verified against a source
- **unknown** — no supporting sources found

<Aside type="tip">
  Skipper always searches the knowledge base before answering factual questions. If it can't find
  relevant documentation, it falls back to web search, then general knowledge — and tells you which
  it used.

## For Agent Developers

If you're building an agent that connects via [MCP](/agents/mcp):

**`ask_consultant`** — sends a question through the full Skipper pipeline: pre-retrieval, query rewriting, HyDE, multi-round tool loop, and confidence tagging. Returns a structured response with `answer`, `confidence`, `sources`, and `tools_used`. Your agent gets the same quality as the dashboard chat without orchestrating the pipeline itself.

Use the `video_consultant` [prompt](/agents/mcp#prompts) alongside `ask_consultant` to give your agent a streaming expert persona with knowledge of diagnostic tools and platform capabilities.

Operators can improve retrieval quality with [cross-encoder reranking, query rewriting, and HyDE](/operators/skipper#retrieval-quality).
