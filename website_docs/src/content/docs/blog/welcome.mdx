Most streaming platforms keep their architecture behind closed doors. You get API docs, a dashboard, and a support email. How the ingest pipeline actually works, how viewer routing decisions are made, how billing enforcement interacts with stream lifecycle — that stays internal.

We think that's backwards. If you're trusting a platform with your live video, you should understand how it works. Not just the API surface, but the design decisions underneath.

This blog is where we write about that. Expect:

- **Architecture deep-dives** — how subsystems are designed, why we made the trade-offs we did, and what we'd do differently
- **Feature launches** — not marketing copy, but technical explanations of what shipped and how it works under the hood
- **Engineering process** — how we test, audit, and operate a multi-tenant streaming platform

No release cadence, no filler. We publish when there's something worth reading.
