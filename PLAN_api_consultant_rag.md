# Plan: Skipper RAG safety + determinism test expansion

- [x] Review api_consultant retrieval/crawl pipeline tests and identify coverage gaps.
- [x] Add tests for crawl idempotency, cache/TTL cleanup behavior, retrieval fallback, and prompt safety.
- [x] Implement minimal production-safe fixes if tests reveal defects.
- [x] Run targeted verification via approved Makefile/scripts where possible.

Sign-off: Completed.
