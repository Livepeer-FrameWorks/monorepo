FrameWorks is dedicated to the public domain.
This means anyone can use FrameWorks for any purpose - including commercial purposes - without any restrictions.

To allow use in jurisdictions where public domain dedications are not recognized, you may instead opt to distribute FrameWorks under the Zero-Clause BSD license.

However, note that while __FrameWorks itself__ is public domain software, __some of its dependencies are not__:

Core Dependencies:
- MistServer: Unlicense (public domain)
- PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL License (permissive, similar to MIT/BSD)
- Apache Kafka: Apache License 2.0
- YugabyteDB Community Edition: Apache License 2.0
- Grafana stack (Grafana, Loki, Tempo): AGPLv3
- Discourse: GPLv2
- Go modules: Various permissive licenses (MIT, BSD, Apache 2.0)
- Node.js dependencies: Various permissive licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0)
- Docker and container runtime dependencies: Various licenses

Note that most of these dependencies use permissive licenses that allow commercial use. The exceptions are:
1. Grafana stack (AGPLv3) and Discourse (GPLv2) which are used as separate services
2. YugabyteDB Enterprise features require a separate license (Community Edition is Apache 2.0)

__The FrameWorks name and logo are not public domain either.__ You have permission to use the FrameWorks name and logo to refer to any version of FrameWorks published by the FrameWorks team, but __not to refer to versions that contain changes not published by the FrameWorks team__.

We hope you find FrameWorks useful, and __encourage mentioning you use FrameWorks__ and/or based your products/services on FrameWorks wherever you consider it appropriate. This is not required, but appreciated.
