# Parlor (Interactive Room Service)

> **Status**: ðŸš§ **Planned** - Microservice not yet implemented

## Overview

Parlor provides persistent, interactive rooms that serve as the social and economic layer of the platform. Rooms are multi-purpose spaces owned by tenants (streamers/creators) that can host various activities: live streams, group video calls, games, predictions, and community economies.

## Core Concepts

**Rooms as Tenant Spaces**: Each tenant (creator) has a primary room that persists 24/7, building community and enabling engagement whether streaming or not.

**Room Economy**: Rooms have their own credit system for predictions, rewards, and interactive features.

## Technical Architecture

### Room Ownership Model
```go
type Room struct {
    ID         string
    TenantID   string  // Owner/creator
    ParentRoom *string // For sub-rooms
    RoomType   string  // primary|sub|event|temporary
    
    // Economic state
    Credits    CreditsConfig
    Rewards    []Reward
    
    // Capabilities
    Features   map[string]bool
    
    // Persistent state
    State      RoomState
    Metadata   map[string]interface{}
}

type CreditsConfig struct {
    Enabled        bool
    EarnRate       float64  // Credits per hour
    StartingAmount int
    Predictions    []ActivePrediction
    RewardsStore   []RewardTier
}
```

### Broadcast Modes
```go
type BroadcastMode string

const (
    ModeSolo      = "solo"       // Traditional single streamer
    ModeStage     = "stage"      // Multiple presenters to audience  
    ModeGroup     = "group"      // Equal participants (Zoom-like)
    ModeHybrid    = "hybrid"     // Mix of presenters and viewers
)
```

## Database Schema (Planned)

```sql
-- Core room with tenant ownership
CREATE TABLE rooms (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    tenant_id UUID REFERENCES tenants(id),
    parent_room_id UUID REFERENCES rooms(id),
    room_type VARCHAR(50),
    broadcast_mode VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Channel credits system
CREATE TABLE channel_credits (
    tenant_id UUID,
    user_id UUID, 
    balance BIGINT,
    total_earned BIGINT,
    total_spent BIGINT,
    PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, user_id)
);

-- Predictions
CREATE TABLE predictions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    room_id UUID REFERENCES rooms(id),
    question TEXT,
    options JSONB,
    total_pot BIGINT,
    outcome VARCHAR(100),
    resolved_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Credit transactions
CREATE TABLE credit_transactions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    tenant_id UUID,
    user_id UUID,
    amount BIGINT,
    transaction_type VARCHAR(50), -- earn|spend|bet|win
    reference_id UUID, -- prediction_id, reward_id, etc
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Build vs Buy Decision

### For Text Chat Component:
- **Consider Existing**: Matrix, Discord widgets
- **Build Custom When**: Deep stream integration needed

### For Room Orchestration:
- **Must Build Custom**: Unique to our platform
- **Leverage WebRTC**: For P2P voice/video

### For Credits/Economy:
- **Build Custom**: Core differentiator
- **Integrate Payment**: For credit purchases

## Monetization Opportunities

1. **Premium Rooms**: Higher participant limits, advanced features
2. **Credit Packages**: Buy channel credits directly
3. **Prediction Fees**: Platform takes % of prediction pots
4. **Branded Rooms**: Custom branding, white-label
5. **API Access**: Developers build on room platform
