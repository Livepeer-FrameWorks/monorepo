# Lookout (Incident Management Service)

Status: **Deferred**. This service is not implemented. Today, monitoring and alerting are handled by Prometheus + Grafana (with VictoriaMetrics for storage).

This directory is a placeholder for a future incident/alert aggregation service. When it exists, it will consolidate incidents and publish them to other services (Signalman, Gateway, dashboards).
